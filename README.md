# 42-Push_swap

## Description

This repository contains a sorting algorithm visualizer project, known as "Push Swap." The primary objective of Push Swap is to sort a stack of integers using a specific set of operations while visualizing the process.

## Key Features

- Sorting stack of integers
- Visualization of sorting process
- Limited set of stack manipulation operations
- Challenge of optimizing sorting algorithms

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Compile the Push Swap program.
3. Run the program with a list of integers as input to observe the sorting process.
